Subject: [PATCH] Fix possible invalid centering

When new windows are placed, clientKeepVisible() is used to possibly center the
window, if it was determined that is was trying to be centered.

That is, it is checked if its position would get it centered based on the whole
screen, and then on each monitors. If so, it gets centered on the current
monitor.

Doing so uses a "margin of error" of 25 pixels (both horizontally and
vertically). That is, if the position if what would get the window centered,
more or less 25 pixels, it's a match.

In my setup, with a main monitor (1440x900) and a second one (1280n1024) on the
right, some windows to be placed in the top-right corner of the main monitor
(e.g. some notifications) would get wrongly matched as trying to be centered,
and therefore get (wrongly) centered.

Lowering the margin of error to 5 pixels should keep re-centering windows that
were centered on the whole screen, while not centering windows that shouldn't
be.
